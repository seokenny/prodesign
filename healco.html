                            HealCo is a web platform specifically made for medical hosts/guests to lease/rent a medically equipped and approved space based on their specialties. For hosts, it allowed easy enlistment of their properties while using a matchmaking system to connect with the ideal guest. For guests, it provided a variety of properties based on the different filters the guests selected.

                            There are 3 categories of users - hosts who were looking to rent out their medically approved space, guests who were looking for medically equipped and approved space, and the admins of HealCo who mediated the information, requests, and applications on the platform. While the hosts and guests have similar experiences, I had to keep in mind the extra features that admins would have through their journey.

                            As HealCo was still a relatively new company, most of their tasks were focused on the completion of its core features. This left the design at a bare minimum.

                            I was brought into HealCo to redesign the entire user interface and experience for their entire HealCo platform - this includes their website, form flows, and dashboard.

                            The biggest issue with HealCo’s initial website was the lack of information. Being the initial starting point for new users, it was crucial to give new visitors information, security, and confidence when applying for HealCo. Users had no idea what services HealCo provided, how it worked, and whether or not HealCo was a legitimate service. Before coming up with a design, I figured out the questions that users asked before committing to a product or service. This information was used to determine the necessary information the website would provide to users.

                            The main issue with the initial form flow was the amount of tediously specific questions that users were required to fill in before being allowed to proceed. Users felt lost and frustrated when asked such specific questions before they were even given a chance to get to the dashboard to see what HealCo had to offer. This led to some users leaving the form mid-way through the process.

                            Addressing the requirements of tedious questions, I first laid out the entire flow process and marked them by importance and relevance. Besides the mandatory questions of personal information, I kept the questions that gave a general idea of what users were looking for. I was able to remove half of the questions asked but still kept enough information for HealCo to categorize and create personalized dashboards and results for each user.

                            Although users received their personalized dashboards, the information and services provided were all over the place. It was difficult for users to navigate through their dashboard to the section they wanted. There was a huge lack of connections and links between information, making the user traverse through the entire dashboard to find the correlated information. There was also a lack of any indications of current progression. Providing the user “what” and “where” they are in any current session is important to keep them on track and being transparent.

I included many necessary hyperlinks for users to click if they wanted more information.

                            I also added a visual of progression so users knew how they were doing in the current flow they were in. One thing I focused on was creating a sense of flow between each feature for the users to follow through. This helped users complete each step without being lost on what they’re required to do next.
