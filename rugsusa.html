                            A huge issue that the analytics team brought to attention was the amount of carts abandoned. Customers would leave the website or cancel purchasing a rug because they were unsure of many components - how the rugs would look, fit, or how difficult it would be to keep clean.

                            Rugs USA’s catalog page features a wide preview of rugs with filters to narrow down searches. Each rug has its own subset of information to give a general idea on the different variations and properties.

                            After consulting with the analytics team, we concluded that there were two main issues.

                        <div class="works_box-image">

                            The <b>first issue</b> was the obscene amount of filters with no structure. There’s no issue with there being a huge selection of filters, but it becomes a hindrance when there is no organization between categories. 
                        </p>
                        <p class="works_box-text-para">
                            The <b>second issue</b> was the lack of useful information within each rug preview card. Crucial information was missing and users were annoyed at having to click on a product to view said information.

                            Since the rug preview cards were the main content of this page, I moved the most popular filters to the top. This provided a wider range of viewable cards per row - lessening the amount of scrolling.

                            Initially, the rug preview cards showed 3 pieces of information - color variations, rug name, and a sale banner. In the age of online shopping, this was nowhere near information. After reviewing what customers requested and viewing successful shopping experiences, I decided on adding 3 more crucial pieces of information - ratings and number of reviews, shipping details, and the actual amount calculated with the current sale.

                            When a customer views a potential rug, they are presented with the rug full view page. This is where the specificities of each rug is presented.

                            The issue of the initial rug full view page was it provided similar information to the rug preview cards; it was too general and didn’t show specificity. Another issue was the lack of useful features to keep customers engaged. There was no personalized information or interactive and engaging features.

                            The first issue I tackled was the lack of specified information. For the main information that Rugs USA provides, I included a sale timer, every color of the rug, each shape that the rug comes in, every sizing, prices and sales prices for all variations, and shipment estimation.

                            Since reviews and other customer experiences are so crucial when purchasing products, I included a section to view full customer reviews, questions and answers, and customer-uploaded photos.

                            These were the main questions and concerns users have given through feedback. Although we did provide general information on the rug full view page, this went into detail on all the possible specifics the users may have.

                            Knowing the needs of the customers is a huge part of confident purchases. It’s stressful for customers when they purchase an item that may or may not meet their expectations. Providing as much detail from different sources of information blocks can dissolve some of that uncertainty. A confident buyer results in more frequent purchases for the present and the future.
